    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I personally tried to put myself into someone else's shoes to try to see what I might look for when using a feature. Creating "user stories" helped with this by getting a feel for what features and what steps might be needed for various tools.

    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
In terms of developing programs, if there is already developed code provided that I will be adding onto, I first try to carefully analyze the existing code to try to figure out how it interacts, so I can properly plan on how to add new code on top. An Agile process I hope to incorporate is, in terms of project development work, getting more involved with groups to properly collaborate on work and stay updated on the current development of the project.

    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member is not only being self sufficient in your own work, but knowing how to properly and efficiently collaborate in a team environment. With working in a team, you don't need to know how to do everything yourself, or at least not have to, but knowing how the needs of the other team members and effectively communicating with them is essential.
